In this project, we build a hybrid movie recommender system using both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques on the MovieLens dataset.
## Introduction

A recommender system is a tool that predicts a user's preferences or ratings for items. It's widely used in different online applications like e-commerce, streaming services, and social media. There are two main types of recommendation systems: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. In this project, we combine both methods into a hybrid recommender system to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches.

## Setup

This project requires several Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, surprise, and fuzzywuzzy. You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy surprise fuzzywuzzy
